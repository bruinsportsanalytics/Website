This equates to an average of 1 three pointer made every 6 games. That same Hawks team went on to the Eastern Conference Semifinals with an overall record of 50-32. 38 years later, on March 3rd 2018, over one half of the Houston Rockets' total shots in their three point victory over the Boston Celtics came from beyond the arc, as they attempted 49 three-pointers, compared to just 38 mid-range shots/layups.</p>

In 2015, the Pelicans - without Jrue Holiday - were swept by the first iteration of the current Warriors Dynasty. Davis's only other postseason appearance came in 2018, when the Pelicans upset the 3-seed Portland Trailblazers in a stunning sweep. Although the Pelicans lost to the Warriors again in the next round, their second round exit was viewed as a success after the enormous loss of <a href="https://stats.nba.com/player/202326/">DeMarcus Cousins</a> in late January due to a ruptured Achilles.</p>

After missing the playoffs for blank consecutive years, the Lakers look to make a playoff run and possibly contend for a championship title with the addition of the NBA's most prominent star. In addition to Lebron James, the Lakers added notable veterans such as Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, and Lance Stephenson. However, the Lakers remain at their core a very young team, with blossoming players with high potentials.</p>

In an easily overlooked rout of the Phoenix Suns, Nikola Jokic recorded a 31-point triple-double with no turnovers while shooting a perfect from the field (11-11), joining Wilt Chamberlain as one of the only two players to ever achieve such a feat, according to a tweet from @ESPNStatsInfo.</p>

He dribbled the ball a few times and calmly knocked down both shots to seal one of the most stunning upsets in playoff history.  The Detroit Pistons had defeated the heavily favored Los Angeles Lakers to become the 2004 NBA Champions.  Hardly anyone could have predicted that this team would overcome the combined talents of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal along with the brilliance of Phil Jackson.  Most analysts give credit to the outstanding defense the Pistons displayed.  Though their offense just placed 7th, this Pistons team had the best ranked defense throughout the playoffs and actually had the highest average defensive rating in postseason history.</p>

Fast forward to 2017-18, and the Houston Rockets are <i>averaging</i> 42.6 three-point field goal attempts per game. In the 20 years since Jordan’s last game, saying that professional basketball has changed would be an understatement. In today’s NBA, the “pace and space” style of play with an emphasis on a primary ball handler surrounded by shooters is the norm; all 30 teams are attempting at least 22 three-point field goals per game compared to the 2004 season, where only one team attempted more than 22 per game. Many of the offensive principles that are prevalent throughout the league can be attributed to current Rockets head coach, Mike D’Antoni. D'Antoni's success with the mid 2000s “Seven Seconds or Less” Phoenix Suns has had a lasting impact on the league today, as many of the same offensive philosophies have been commandeered by other coaches.</p>
